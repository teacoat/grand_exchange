# The Grand Exchange
--- Please note, due to playcanvas being a browser based game engine with built in version control it is impossible to include the game files in this repo

The Grand Exchange is a realtime peer-to-peer trading experience. Users are able to create and join rooms to take part in socializing or trading crypto assets. 

Things needed to test:
- HashPack (preferably, its what I tested with)
- Testnet account
- Tokens in the testnet account - you can create tokens in hashpack through menu > advanced tools > token creator
- A desktop computer, not mobile compatible
- Multiple people

Please watch the video here for a walkthrough of the experience: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hOgLDdYIsUBboifSJl4sZj6onudLjXfo/view
