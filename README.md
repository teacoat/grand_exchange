# The Grand Exchange
--- Please note, due to playcanvas being a browser based game engine with built in version control it is impossible to include the game files in this repo.

The Grand Exchange is a realtime peer-to-peer trading experience. Users are able to create and join rooms to take part in socializing or trading crypto assets. 

This project fits into the Defi category, as its a way to trade tokens and NFT's in a unique way that emphasizes discoverability through rooms, it also fits into the trailblazer category as its sort of unconventional in terms of Defi.

Things needed to test:
- HashPack (preferably, its what I tested with)
- Testnet account
- Tokens in the testnet account - you can create tokens in HashPack through menu > advanced tools > token creator
- A desktop computer, not mobile compatible
- Multiple people
